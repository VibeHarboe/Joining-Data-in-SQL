## ðŸ“„ SQL Files Overview

* [01_inner_join.sql](01_inner_join.sql) â€“ INNER JOIN examples combining geographic, economic, and language data:

  * Link cities with countries to analyze regional characteristics
  * Join countries with economies and languages to retrieve contextual information
  * Combine three tables to compare fertility and unemployment rates across years

* [02_left_right_join.sql](02_left_right_join.sql) â€“ LEFT and RIGHT JOIN use cases for inclusive joins and join equivalency:

  * Retrieve cities even when country data is missing
  * Aggregate GDP per region using LEFT JOIN with GROUP BY
  * Identify unmatched records using IS NULL
  * Demonstrate RIGHT JOIN equivalency by reversing LEFT JOIN logic

* [03_full_join.sql](03_full_join.sql) â€“ FULL OUTER JOIN examples to analyze unmatched data, classify match status, and explore regional relationships:

  * Identify missing matches between countries and currencies
  * Count and classify join results using CASE and aggregation
  * Chain FULL OUTER JOINs across multiple dimensions (e.g., languages, currencies)

* [04_self_join.sql](04_self_join.sql) â€“ SELF JOIN examples showcasing organizational hierarchies and time-based population comparison:

  * Link employees to their managers across departments
  * Compare population data for the same country across two time periods
  * Calculate and filter countries by population growth using CTEs

* [05_cross_join.sql](05_cross_join.sql) â€“ CROSS JOIN queries to generate combinations and validate data completeness:

  * Generate all combinations between products and regions
  * Simulate pricing strategies across tiers
  * Detect missing expected pairings (e.g., department-location coverage)
  * Explore possible language-country pairings in historical context

* [06_join_missing.sql](06_join_missing.sql) â€“ Using JOINs to identify unmatched or missing records:

  * Detect countries without currency entries and vice versa
  * Highlight year-specific gaps using LEFT JOIN with filter conditions
  * Use FULL OUTER JOINs for mismatch detection across entire tables

* [07_join_comparison.sql](07_join_comparison.sql) â€“ Comparative JOINs to evaluate INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOIN behaviors:

  * Compare row counts and result differences across join types
  * Analyze dataset completeness and exclusivity based on join logic
 
* [08_union_set_operations.sql](08_set_operations.sql) â€“ Set theory operations in SQL for comparing, combining, and filtering datasets:
  
  * Use UNION and UNION ALL to merge records from different sources with or without duplicates
  * Identify shared records using INTERSECT
  * Detect missing or exclusive records using EXCEPT in both directions

* [09_subqueries.sql](09_subqueries.sql) â€“ Subquery techniques across SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses to enable advanced data filtering, aggregation, and comparison:
  * Identify distinct values using semi joins and anti joins
  * Compare values to global or group-based averages using nested WHERE conditions
  * Calculate metrics per row using subqueries inside SELECT
  * Join summarized data back into the main query using subqueries inside FROM
  * Filter results based on textual attributes and hierarchy (e.g. government form, capital cities)
  * Apply subqueries to advanced geographic and demographic analysis (e.g. city populations, regional language counts)
