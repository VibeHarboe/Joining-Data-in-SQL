-- 02_left_right_join.sql â€“ LEFT and RIGHT JOIN use cases for partial matches and inclusive analysis:
-- Retrieve all cities even if country data is missing (LEFT JOIN)
-- Aggregate GDP per region using LEFT JOIN and GROUP BY
-- Identify missing data using LEFT JOIN with IS NULL
-- Demonstrate equivalency of RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN with reversed tables


-- ========================================================
-- SECTION 1: LEFT JOIN - Cities and Countries
-- ========================================================

-- Returns all records from cities (AS c1), with matching country info if available
-- Useful for finding cities with or without a matching country record
SELECT 
    c1.name AS city, 
    code, 
    c2.name AS country,
    region, 
    city_proper_pop
FROM cities AS c1
LEFT JOIN countries AS c2
  ON c1.country_code = c2.code
ORDER BY code DESC;


-- ========================================================
-- SECTION 2: LEFT JOIN + Aggregation - Average GDP by Region (2010)
-- ========================================================

-- Calculate average GDP per capita per region in 2010
SELECT 
  region, 
  AVG(gdp_percapita) AS avg_gdp
FROM countries AS c
LEFT JOIN economies AS e
  USING(code)
WHERE year = 2010
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY avg_gdp DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- ========================================================
-- SECTION 3: LEFT JOIN with IS NULL - Unmatched City Records
-- ========================================================

-- Identify cities that do not have a corresponding country record
-- Useful for data validation or identifying missing reference data
SELECT 
    c1.name AS city,
    c1.country_code,
    c1.city_proper_pop
FROM cities AS c1
LEFT JOIN countries AS c2
  ON c1.country_code = c2.code
WHERE c2.code IS NULL
ORDER BY c1.name;



-- ========================================================
-- SECTION 4: RIGHT JOIN Equivalent to LEFT JOIN
-- ========================================================

-- Demonstrates how RIGHT JOIN can produce the same result as LEFT JOIN
-- Retrieves all countries, whether or not a language match exists
SELECT 
  countries.name AS country, 
  languages.name AS language, 
  percent
FROM languages
RIGHT JOIN countries
  USING(code)
ORDER BY language;
