# 🔗 Joining Data in SQL
Joining relational data with SQL: INNER, OUTER, self &amp; cross joins + data handling strategies.

## 🧠 Project Description

This project documents my completion of the DataCamp course *Joining Data in SQL*.  
The goal was to learn how to combine relational datasets and extract meaningful insights using SQL joins.

The course involved hands-on exercises that focused on combining tables using different types of joins and handling missing or inconsistent data across datasets.

## 🧰 Key Skills Acquired

- SQL joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`
- `SELF JOIN` and `CROSS JOIN`
- Multi-table data analysis
- Relational data integration
- Handling mismatched and NULL values
