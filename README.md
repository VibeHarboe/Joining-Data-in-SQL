# 🔗 Joining Data in SQL  
Combining relational data using INNER, OUTER, SELF, and CROSS JOINs, plus techniques for handling mismatched and incomplete records.

## 🧠 Project Description  
This project documents my completion of the DataCamp course *Joining Data in SQL*.  
The objective was to master SQL JOIN operations to integrate relational datasets and uncover actionable insights.

The course included hands-on SQL exercises that emphasized joining strategies, data validation, and working with NULLs and unmatched records across tables.

## 🧰 Key Skills Acquired  
- SQL JOINs: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`  
- `SELF JOIN` and `CROSS JOIN`  
- Multi-table data analysis  
- Relational data integration  
- Detecting and handling mismatched or missing data  

## 📁 Project Structure  
- `sql/` → Practice-ready SQL queries grouped by JOIN type  
- `data/` → Example datasets (if shareable)  
- `docs/` → Technical notes and JOIN-type explanations  
- `visuals/` → Query results and screenshots from exercises  
- `certificate.pdf` → Certificate of course completion
